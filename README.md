## Ember SEO

This is a work in progress set of files that make Ember sites SEO friendly by:

* implementing hashbang urls in your Ember app
* invoking a rake task that takes a snapshot of your site with poltergeist
* serving the correct static files to Google by properly handling requests with "_escaped_fragment_"
